//Stdin & Stdout problem
//You need read first integer from stdin, which will tell you # of elements you need to read
//After that you need to read all those numbers & print them all
//example:
//Input: 3, 12, 23, 45
//Output: 12, 23, 45

import java.util.Scanner; //importing java library for scanning

public class StdInStdOut    //Creating class called StdInStdOut
{
  public static void main(String[] args)    //Creating main class
  {
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);    //Creating scanner class input
    
    int count = scanner.nextInt();    //Creating a count variable that scans next couple of integers
    
    int myIntArray[] = new int[count];
    int index = 0;
    
  }
